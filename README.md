# Probabilistic Programming with Scala

This repository contains an implementation of the examples contained in the paper “Functional probabilistic programming for scalable Bayesian modelling” using the [Rainier](https://github.com/stripe/rainier/) modelling language.

This repository also contains implementations of forward and reverse mode automatic differentiation and a test suite.
